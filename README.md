Create a rails app that has one root page that is a calculator.  

It implements these operators (say +, -, /,*) _on any number of integer arguments._  
The page has only a text box and a submit button.
The requested operation and its result should be displayed below the text box after clicking the calculate button.
 
Input example:
```
5*3+1+6/2+9*100
```
Expected output:
```
5*3+1+6/2+9*100
919
```
 
Input example:
```
5*3+1+6/85+9*100
```
Expected output:
```
5*3+1+6/85+9*100
916.07
```
